hello!!
Long ago, there lived a little boy named Sammy. He was a good boy. He was good in his studies, 
obedient to his parents, more intelligent than many other boys in his class and kind to everyone.
Grown-ups as well as those junior to Sammy loved him very much.
But that aroused jealousy in many other boys who longed to be as loved as Sammy

Now there was another boy named Timmy who studied in the same class as Sammy.
 Unlike Sammy, he was not good at studies and always liked to play during school hours. 
He misbehaved with his parents, bullied his classmates and even ill-treated Sammy. 
He always tried to put Sammy down and belittled him before other kids in the class.
 But no matter what he did, Sammy's grades kept getting better and better. 
Whether in studies or in sports or from his classmates,
 Sammy kept getting accolades from everywhere.
